RPi Telecine Project 3D Models
==============================

These models were created using Freecad parametric design, using v0.14
unstable version. http://freecadweb.org/

STL files were exported and printed using [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/) and 
[3dPrintuk](http://www.3dprint-uk.co.uk/). Film transport rollers were printed using
Shapeways' frosted detail plastic. Seems to work better than Nylon. The gate and camera
mount were printed using Shapeways black nylon. Other parts were standard white nylon.
